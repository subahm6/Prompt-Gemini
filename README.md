This project is designed to create a web application using Streamlit and integrate it with the Gemini API for machine learning model predictions. The project contains two main components:

page.py: A Streamlit application for designing and interacting with the web page.
model.py: A script for interfacing with the Gemini API to make predictions.

Usage
Running the Streamlit App
To run the Streamlit application:

Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
Run the following command:
sh
Copy code
streamlit run page.py
This will start a local server, and you can view the app in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

Using the Gemini API
The model.py script is designed to interface with the Gemini API. Here's how to use it:

Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
Edit the configuration section in model.py to include your Gemini API credentials.
