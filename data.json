        "Question": "tell me what is baby",
        "Answer": "A baby is a young child, typically from birth to the age of one or two years old. Babies are characterized by their rapid physical and mental development, as well as their dependence on caregivers.\n\n**Physical Development**\n\n* Babies grow rapidly in the first few months of life. They gain weight, grow taller, and develop their motor skills.\n* By the age of one, most babies can sit up, crawl, and stand.\n* They also begin to develop their fine motor skills, such as grasping and picking up objects.\n\n**Mental Development**\n\n* Babies learn and develop at a rapid pace. They learn to recognize familiar objects and people, and they begin to understand language.\n* By the age of one, most babies can say a few words, and they understand many more.\n* They also begin to develop their problem-solving skills and their ability to think symbolically.\n\n**Dependence on Caregivers**\n\n* Babies are completely dependent on their caregivers for survival. They need to be fed, cleaned, and changed regularly.\n* They also need emotional support and stimulation from their caregivers.\n* The relationship between a baby and its caregivers is essential for the baby's healthy development.\n\n**Types of Babies**\n\n* There are many different types of babies, including:\n    * Full-term babies: Babies who are born at 37 weeks or later of gestation.\n    * Preterm babies: Babies who are born before 37 weeks of gestation.\n    * Low-birth-weight babies: Babies who weigh less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces at birth.\n    * Multiple-birth babies: Babies who are born as part of a multiple pregnancy, such as twins or triplets.\n\n**Baby Care**\n\n* Baby care is the process of providing for the physical and emotional needs of a baby. This includes:\n    * Feeding the baby\n    * Changing the baby's diaper\n    * Bathing the baby\n    * Putting the baby to sleep\n    * Playing with the baby\n    * Talking to the baby\n    * Providing the baby with emotional support\n\n**Babies are a joy to be around. They are full of wonder and curiosity, and they have a unique way of seeing the world. Babies teach us about the importance of love, patience, and unconditional acceptance.**"

        "Question": "what is eye",
        "Answer": "The eye is a complex organ that allows us to see the world around us. It is located in the front of the skull and is protected by the bony orbit. The eye is made up of many different parts, including the cornea, pupil, iris, lens, retina, and optic nerve.\n\n**Cornea**\n\nThe cornea is the clear, dome-shaped outer layer of the eye. It covers the front of the eye and helps to focus light on the retina. The cornea is also responsible for protecting the eye from foreign objects.\n\n**Pupil**\n\nThe pupil is the black hole in the center of the eye. It is the opening through which light enters the eye. The size of the pupil is controlled by the iris.\n\n**Iris**\n\nThe iris is the colored part of the eye. It is made up of muscle fibers that control the size of the pupil. The iris also helps to protect the eye from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays.\n\n**Lens**\n\nThe lens is a clear, flexible structure that is located behind the iris. It helps to focus light on the retina. The lens changes shape to focus on objects that are near or far away.\n\n**Retina**\n\nThe retina is a thin layer of tissue that lines the back of the eye. It contains millions of light-sensitive cells called photoreceptors. Photoreceptors convert light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain.\n\n**Optic Nerve**\n\nThe optic nerve is a bundle of nerve fibers that connects the retina to the brain. It carries the electrical signals from the photoreceptors to the brain.\n\n**How the Eye Works**\n\nWhen light enters the eye, it passes through the cornea and pupil. The lens then focuses the light on the retina. The photoreceptors in the retina convert the light into electrical signals. These signals are then sent to the brain through the optic nerve. The brain interprets the signals and creates an image of the world around us.\n\n**Eye Care**\n\nIt is important to take care of your eyes. Here are some tips for good eye care:\n\n* Get regular eye exams.\n* Wear sunglasses when you are outdoors.\n* Eat a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.\n* Avoid smoking.\n* Get regular exercise.\n* Use artificial tears if your eyes are dry.\n* See your doctor if you have any eye problems, such as pain, redness, or vision problems."

He joined the BJP in 1987 and was elected to the Gujarat Legislative Assembly in 1990. He served as Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, during which time he oversaw the state's economic growth and social development.\n\nModi's divisive policies have been criticized by many. He has been accused of promoting majoritarianism, inciting violence against Muslim minority communities, and undermining the secular fabric of India. Modi's policies have also been criticized for their impact on the poor and marginalized communities.\n\nModi's economic policies have been aimed at increasing economic growth and foreign investment. He has focused on infrastructure development, industrialization, and skill development. His flagship policies include the \"Make in India\" initiative, which aims to attract foreign investment and boost manufacturing in India, and the \"Digital India\" initiative, which aims to increase internet access and digital literacy in the country.\n\nModi's foreign policy has been focused on developing closer relations with other countries, particularly in the Asia- pacific region. He has also sought to improve relations with India's neighbors, including Pakistan and China.\n\nModi's popularity declined after the demonetisation of Indian Rupee 500 and 1000 notes in 2016, which caused widespread disruption and economic slowdown. However, he retained his popularity and returned to power with a lower majority in the 2019 general election.\n\nModi's rise to power has been a major turning point in Indian politics. He has been credited with transforming the BJP into a major political force and ushering in a new era of right-wing nationalism in India.
